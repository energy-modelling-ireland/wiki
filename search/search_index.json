Members by Organisation Codema - Dublin's Energy Agency Ois\u00edn is an Junior Energy Systems Analyst at Codema - Dublin's Energy Agency . He is a UCD graduate working on the Dublin Region Energy Masterplan, primarily through the form of open-sourced Python scripting for which more info can be found on our codema-dev Github. NUI Galway Paul is a Postdoctoral Researcher with his research work focusing on sustainable construction technologies for building and retrofitting residential buildings, developing one-stop-shop retrofit services and the examining the interrelationships between building occupants, building systems, and building energy consumption. He is currently working on the EU funded TURNKEY RETROFIT project which aims to create a service which will transform the complex and fragmented renovation process into a simple, straightforward and attractive process for the home-owner. The service will be accessible through a user-friendly digital platform and it will address drivers of building renovation that go beyond a desire to reduce energy bills and increase asset value, such as home improvement, increased comfort, enhanced health and quality of life. SEAI Usman's primary research areas are urban building energy modeling, energy performance certification, machine learning, data mining, GIS modeling, and intelligent computing. He joined UCD Energy Institute as a Senior Energy Policy Researcher in collaboration with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in 2021. He will be involved in developing future proof energy performance certification and methodologies. Usman has completed his PhD on 'A data-driven GIS-based approach for multi-scale residential building energy modeling' in 2020. He received a BS in Computer Science from IIUI in 2008 and an MS in Computer Science from LUMS in 2013. He has also worked as a Research Associate in the field of smart grid, energy management, and software development. TUDublin A chartered building services engineer currently serving as Head of Building Engineering within the College of Engineering and Built Environment in Technological University Dublin. Dr. Ahern is a funded investigator with SFI/MaREI with active research activity in the area of energy resilience within the built environment. Alongside an academic career, Dr. Ahern has 12 years industrial experience practicing as a consultant design engineer on residential and commercial building projects. Dr. Ahern's research interests involve building energy stock modelling and she is currently investigating how modelling outputs to inform policy can be made in real-time and in a robust fashion using artificial intelligence and machine learning to advance current analysis techniques. Dr. Ahern has been using the Irish housing stock for case study analysis for over 10 years and is expert in thermo-physical characteristics of the Irish housing stock, having tested the viability of integrating heat pumps into the thermally refurbished stock in 2010.
